# Hand-gesture-control-
Talking and gestures go hand in hand, sharing meaning and function. They enrich communication by combining in time, emphasizing the speaker's knowledge and experiences in a simple way.


ðŸš€ Brief Idea
When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speakerâ€™s underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context.
